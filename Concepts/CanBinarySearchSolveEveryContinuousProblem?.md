# Can Binary Search Solve Every Continuous Problem?

Binary search is a highly efficient algorithm, especially when it comes to problems where the search space can be systematically reduced. However, it is not a one-size-fits-all solution for every continuous problem. Below are some conditions and limitations.

## Conditions for Binary Search Applicability

1. **Monotonic Function**: The function `f(x)` should be monotonic (either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing) in the interval `[a, b]`.
2. **Boundaries**: You need initial points `a` and `b` such that the answer lies between them.
3. **Existence of Solution**: A solution `x` must exist within `[a, b]` that makes `f(x)` satisfy your condition.
4. **Computable Function**: `f(x)` should be computable within the computational resources allowed.
5. **Tolerance**: The algorithm will provide an approximate answer within some tolerance `Îµ`.

## Types of Problems Where Binary Search Might Not Work

1. **Multiple Solutions**: If there are multiple values satisfying the constraints, binary search will find one but not necessarily all.
2. **Non-Monotonic Functions**: Binary search will fail if `f(x)` isn't monotonic.
3. **Complexity of Function**: If `f(x)` is computationally expensive, binary search may not be efficient.
4. **Global Optimization Problems**: Binary search is a local optimization technique.
5. **Constraints**: Additional constraints may make binary search insufficient.
