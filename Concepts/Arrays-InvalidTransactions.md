## Invalid Transactions

This problem deals with analyzing a list of transactions and identifying which transactions are possibly invalid based on certain conditions. Let's break down the concept and approach in a simple and easy-to-understand manner:

### Concept and Approach:

1. **Transaction Representation**:
   - Each transaction is represented as a string with comma-separated values: `name`, `time`, `amount`, and `city`.
   - We want to process and analyze these transactions to determine if they are possibly invalid.

2. **Parsing Transactions**:
   - We are given an array of transaction strings. To make it easier to work with, we can parse these strings into objects. Each object holds the individual values of the transaction: `name`, `time`, `amount`, and `city`.

3. **Sorting Transactions**:
   - We sort the transactions based on their `time` values. This allows us to process them in chronological order.

4. **Iterating Through Transactions**:
   - We iterate through the sorted transactions one by one.
   - For each transaction, we consider two conditions to determine if it's possibly invalid:
     - Condition 1: If the transaction amount is greater than or equal to $1000, it's invalid.
     - Condition 2: If there's another transaction with the same `name` within 60 minutes and in a different `city`, it's invalid.

5. **Efficiently Finding Transactions Within a Time Range**:
   - To efficiently find transactions that occurred within a time range of the current transaction, we use two pointers (`left` and `right`).
   - We move the `right` pointer to the right until the time difference between the transaction at `right` and the current transaction is within 60 minutes.
   - We also move the `left` pointer to the right until the time difference between the transaction at `left` and the current transaction is greater than 60 minutes.

6. **Checking for Invalid Cities**:
   - While moving the `right` pointer, we check if the transactions have the same `name` and different `city`. If this condition is met, the transaction is invalid.

7. **Storing Invalid Transactions**:
   - For each transaction that satisfies either of the invalid conditions, we store its index in a list of invalid transaction indices.

8. **Gathering Details of Invalid Transactions**:
   - Once we have the indices of invalid transactions, we can gather their details and construct a list of strings representing the invalid transactions.

### Example in C++:

Here's a C++ example implementing the approach for identifying possibly invalid transactions:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

struct Transaction {
    string name;
    int time;
    int amount;
    string city;

    Transaction() {}

    Transaction(string& s) {
        build(s);
    }

    void build(string& s) {
        int i = 0, n = s.size();
        time = amount = 0;
        while (s[i] != ',')
            name.push_back(s[i++]);
        ++i;
        while (s[i] != ',')
            time = time * 10 + s[i++] - '0';
        ++i;
        while (s[i] != ',')
            amount = amount * 10 + s[i++] - '0';
        ++i;
        while (i < n)
            city.push_back(s[i++]);
    }

    string toString() {
        return name + "," + to_string(time) + "," + to_string(amount) + "," + city;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> invalidTransactions(vector<string>& transactions) {
        // Convert input strings into transaction objects and sort by time
        vector<Transaction> allTransactions;
        for (string& transactionStr : transactions) {
            Transaction transaction(transactionStr);
            allTransactions.push_back(transaction);
        }
        sort(allTransactions.begin(), allTransactions.end(), [](Transaction& t1, Transaction& t2) {
            return t1.time < t2.time;
            });

        for (int i = 0;i < allTransactions.size();i++) {
            cout << allTransactions[i].toString() << endl;
        }
        cout << endl;

        int left = 0, right = 0;
        vector<int> invalidTransactionIndices;
        for (int i = 0; i < allTransactions.size(); ++i) {
            while (right < allTransactions.size() && allTransactions[right].time <= allTransactions[i].time + 60) {
                right++;
            }
            while (left < i && allTransactions[left].time < allTransactions[i].time - 60) {
                left++;
            }
            cout << right << ":" << left << endl;

            // Check if the current transaction is invalid
            if (allTransactions[i].amount >= 1000) {
                // Condition 1: Amount exceeds $1000
                invalidTransactionIndices.push_back(i);
            }
            else {
                bool foundInvalidCity = false;
                for (int j = left; j < right; ++j) {
                    if (allTransactions[j].name == allTransactions[i].name && allTransactions[j].city != allTransactions[i].city) {
                        foundInvalidCity = true;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (foundInvalidCity) {
                    // Condition 2: Transaction in a different city within 60 minutes
                    invalidTransactionIndices.push_back(i);
                }
            }
        }

        // Gather details of invalid transactions
        vector<string> invalidTransactionsList;
        for (int index : invalidTransactionIndices) {
            invalidTransactionsList.push_back(allTransactions[index].toString());
        }

        return invalidTransactionsList;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<string> transactions = { "alex,676,260,bangkok","bob,800,1366,bangkok","alex,393,616,bangkok","bob,820,990,amsterdam","alex,596,1390,amsterdam" };
    vector<string> invalidTransactionsList = solution.invalidTransactions(transactions);

    for (const string& invalidTransaction : invalidTransactionsList) {
        cout << invalidTransaction << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The outputs will be:

```
alice,20,800,mtv
alice,50,100,beijing
```

### Time Complexity:
- Parsing transactions and sorting: O(n * log n)
- Iterating through transactions and checking conditions: O(n * k), where k is the average number of transactions within a 60-minute window

### Space Complexity:
- Additional space for storing transactions: O(n)
- Additional space for storing invalid transaction indices and details: O(n)
